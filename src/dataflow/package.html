The Dataflow package is in charge of handling the flow of data through
the information processing grid. The information processing grid (or
plainly grid), consists of a number of cells. Each cell can be
connected to other cells. The output of a cell is forwarded as input
into following cells. If an input-cell is adjusted, a cascade of
recalculations occurs. Propagating the effects of the new value to
connected cells in the grid.

The idea behind organizing the information in cells is that the
adjustment of a single input parameter will not result in the complete
recalculation of all information, but only in the recalculation of the
affected information.
