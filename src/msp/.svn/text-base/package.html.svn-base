This package contains all classes and functions related to the
computations of MSP. First of all, it contains the data cube
datastructure, used for representing a data set or a sample.
A DataCube can be manipulated and is in charge of calculating
the MSP of the represented dataset. Secondly, this package contains
code to keep track of dependencies between objects. Signals are fired
to objects based on these dependencies. For example, if new files are
added the MSP is recalculated. A recalculation of the MSP results in a
redisplaying of the data and the results. Thirdly, it contains a class
with all the default values.
